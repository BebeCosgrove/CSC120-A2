What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?

I would say that it was easy to do everything once I understood that you were simply using the same functions that are in main but you have to change them to have self in order for them to be object oriented. This isn't an entirely hard assignment it's just a little confusing at first to understand what you are being asked to do. I would say if someone is confused on this in the future to go to TA hours because I think those are very helpful.
